# 🏘️ Microburbs Investment Score Analysis

## Overview

A comprehensive **investment analysis tool** for Australian residential property investors that combines multiple data sources to provide actionable investment recommendations.

## 🎯 What This Analysis Provides

The **Microburbs Investment Score** is a data-driven composite metric (0-100) that evaluates suburbs based on:

### Score Formula:
```
Investment Score = G(35%) + P(15%) + Y(25%) + A(15%) + L(10%)

Where:
  G = Price Growth (12-month appreciation)
  P = Affordability (median price relative to market)
  Y = Rental Yield (estimated return on investment)
  A = Accessibility (proximity to major roads)
  L = Market Liquidity (transaction activity trends)
```

## 📊 Interpretation for Investors

| Score Range | Meaning | Investment Signal |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **> 75** | Strong growth + rental yield + good accessibility | **Ideal short- to mid-term buy** |
| **60-75** | Steady growth, balanced returns | **Moderate risk, solid entry point** |
| **45-60** | Average yield, slow appreciation | **Hold or long-term accumulation** |
| **30-45** | Weak growth, liquidity issues | **Caution advised** |
| **< 30** | Overvalued / isolated / low yield | **Avoid** |

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. Price Growth Score (35 points)
```python
Growth % = (Recent 12m Median - Previous 12m Median) / Previous × 100
Score = min(35, (Growth % / 10) × 35)
```
- Measures capital appreciation potential
- 10% growth = maximum 35 points

### 2. Affordability Score (15 points)
```python
Score = 15 - (Median Price / Market Max) × 15
```
- Lower price = higher score
- Helps identify value opportunities

### 3. Rental Yield Score (25 points)
```python
Yield % = (Annual Rent / Property Price) × 100
Score = min(25, (Yield % / 6) × 25)
```
- Estimated from industry benchmarks
- 6% yield = maximum 25 points

### 4. Accessibility Score (15 points)
```python
Score = max(0, 15 - (Distance to Road / 5000m) × 15)
```
- Proximity to motorways, primary, secondary roads
- Closer = better connectivity

### 5. Market Liquidity Score (10 points)
```python
Activity Change % = (Recent Sales - Previous Sales) / Previous × 100
Score = min(10, 5 + (Activity Change % / 100) × 5)
```
- Increasing activity = easier to buy/sell

   - Cannot analyze other states

3. **Sample size constraints** - Only suburbs with 3+ recent transactions
