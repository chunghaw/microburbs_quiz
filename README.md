## üìä What is the Market Momentum Score?

The Market Momentum Score is a composite metric (0-100) that combines three key factors:

### Score Components:

1. **Price Growth Score (40%)** - Measures median price change over the last 6 months vs previous 6 months
2. **Market Activity Score (30%)** - Analyzes transaction volume trends and market liquidity
3. **Value Score (30%)** - Evaluates current pricing relative to recent trends to identify value

### Score Categories:

- **80-100:** üî• **Hot Market** - Strong buy signals, high competition, act quickly
- **60-79:** üìà **Growing** - Positive momentum, good opportunities with lower competition
- **40-59:** ‚öñÔ∏è **Stable** - Steady performance, suitable for conservative investors
- **20-39:** üìâ **Cooling** - Exercise caution, may indicate declining demand
- **0-19:** ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Cold** - High risk, requires deeper due diligence

## üìà Interpretation Guide

### For Investors with Limited Statistical Knowledge:

**Think of the Momentum Score like a weather forecast:**
- **80-100 (Hot):** Sunny and hot - the market is on fire, everyone wants to buy here
- **60-79 (Growing):** Warm and pleasant - good weather ahead, comfortable investing
- **40-59 (Stable):** Mild - steady and predictable, no surprises
- **20-39 (Cooling):** Getting chilly - market slowing down, be careful
- **0-19 (Cold):** Freezing - market is cold, stay away unless you know what you're doing

### What Each Component Means:

**Price Growth:** How much property values have increased (or decreased) in the last 6 months
- Positive growth = Prices going up = Good for sellers, shows demand
- Negative growth = Prices going down = Caution, but could be opportunity

**Market Activity:** How many properties are being sold
- Increasing activity = More buyers and sellers = Liquid market = Easier to buy/sell
- Decreasing activity = Fewer transactions = Harder to sell if needed

**Value Score:** Whether current prices are reasonable
- High value score = Prices are in a good range, not overheated
- Low value score = Prices might be too high, could be a bubble

## üìä Methodology

### Data Sources:
- **Transactions Dataset:** 5,576 property transactions (2002-2025)
- **GNAF Properties:** 70,591 property records with geocoding
- **Data Quality:** 99.7% valid transactions with price data

### Calculation Approach:

1. **Time Windows:**
   - Recent Period: Last 6 months
   - Previous Period: 6-12 months ago
   - Minimum: 3 transactions per period for reliability

2. **Price Growth Score (0-40 points):**
   - Compares median prices between periods
   - 10% growth = maximum score
   - Normalized to 0-40 scale

3. **Activity Score (0-30 points):**
   - Measures transaction volume change
   - Increasing activity = higher score
   - 50% increase = maximum score

4. **Value Score (0-30 points):**
   - Analyzes price per sqm trends
   - Sweet spot: Recent prices 95-115% of historical average
   - Prevents overvaluation alerts

### Accuracy & Limitations:

**Accuracy:** High for data-rich suburbs (3+ suburbs with 100+ transactions each)

**Limitations:**
- Requires minimum 3 recent transactions per suburb
- Limited to areas with transaction data
- Price per sqm analysis requires land size data
- Does not account for property condition, renovations, or unique features
- Cannot predict sudden market shocks or policy changes

## üêõ Current Bugs & Future Improvements

### Known Issues:
- Limited suburbs in current dataset (only 3 met minimum transaction threshold)
- Property type differentiation not granular (houses vs units)
- No integration with external data (e.g., infrastructure projects, school catchments)

### Potential Fixes (Given More Time):
- Lower minimum transaction threshold to 2 (with confidence intervals)
- Add property type segmentation
- Include seasonal adjustments for market cycles
- Integrate rental yield data for income investors

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Additional Metrics:**
   - Days on market trends
   - Auction clearance rates
   - Rental yield analysis
   - School catchment quality scores

2. **Predictive Features:**
   - Machine learning price forecasts
   - Risk assessment models
   - Infrastructure impact analysis

3. **User Features:**
   - Interactive web dashboard
   - Email alerts for score changes
   - Suburb comparison tool
   - Investment calculator with ROI projections

### Scaling Challenges (Whole Country):
**Challenge:** Processing 15+ million transactions nationwide, real-time updates
**Modifications Required:**
- Database backend (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) instead of files
- Distributed computing (Apache Spark) for calculations
- API rate limiting and caching
- Regional data centers for low latency
- Automated data pipeline for daily updates

## üìù Approach & Learnings

### Initial Approach:
Started with the goal of creating a simple, actionable metric for investors without technical backgrounds. Explored multiple approaches including pure price-based indices and volume-only metrics before settling on a balanced composite score.

### Pivots Made:
- Initially planned purely quantitative scoring, pivoted to include value assessment to prevent overvaluation alerts
- Changed from absolute growth to normalized scores to allow cross-suburb comparisons
- Simplified category names from technical terms to emoji-based labels for accessibility

### Key Learnings:
Data quality is critical - spent significant time filtering invalid transactions. The sweet spot is balancing sophistication with interpretability. Investors need actionable insights, not just numbers. Visual communication is as important as numerical accuracy.

## ü§î Task Reflection

### What I Thought:
Excellent real-world task that balances technical analysis with practical usability. Appreciated the focus on investor needs and accessibility. The open-ended nature allowed creativity while the strict word limits forced clear, concise thinking. Great test of both technical skills and business communication.

### Challenges:
Balancing statistical rigor with simplicity for non-technical users was the main challenge. Also, working with limited data required careful threshold selection to ensure reliability. The 40-word limits were surprisingly difficult but valuable for clarity.
