## Paste the code here. Don't worry about formatting.

### Main Analysis Scripts:
```python
# See repository files:
# comprehensive_analysis.py - Multi-period analysis (1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 9Y)
# final_analysis.py - Single period analysis
# explore_data.py - Data exploration

# Full code available at: https://github.com/chunghaw/microburbs_quiz
```

Key components:
- Multi-period analysis engine (4 time horizons)
- Investment score calculation: G(35%)+P(15%)+Y(25%)+A(15%)+L(10%)
- Road proximity analysis using geospatial data
- Rental yield estimation with Sydney benchmarks
- Reliability weighting based on sample size
- Comparative trend analysis
- Comprehensive visualization generation

## Provide a public URL of a self-explanatory screenshot that best showcases what your code does.
**Screenshot URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chunghaw/microburbs_quiz/main/comprehensive_multi_period_analysis.png

**Shows:** Multi-period investment analysis comparing 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 9-year trends with score comparisons, growth evolution, reliability indicators, and period-specific rankings.

## How have you approached the task, including any pivots you made and learnings along the way. (40 words max.)

Created comprehensive multi-period investment scoring system analyzing 1Y/3Y/5Y/9Y trends. Pivoted from single-period to time-series comparison after discovering 1,350 transactions since 2016. Added reliability weighting. Revealed short-term spikes versus long-term consistency, enabling time-horizon-specific investment strategies for different investor needs.

---

## What does your final code do? (40 words max.)

Analyzes eleven Sydney suburbs across four time periods (1Y/3Y/5Y/9Y) using weighted formula G(35%)+P(15%)+Y(25%)+A(15%)+L(10%). Compares 1,350 transactions since 2016. Identifies WILLOUGHBY as most consistent long-term performer versus ROSEVILLE's volatile short-term spike. Generates period-specific investment recommendations with reliability indicators.

---

## How should investors interpret your results? (40 words max.)

Compare scores across periods to match investment horizon. Consistent high scores (WILLOUGHBY: 72.9 across 9Y) indicate reliable long-term growth. Volatile scores (ROSEVILLE: 71.5 in 1Y, 31.9 in 3Y) suggest risky short-term spikes. Higher reliability ratings (VERY HIGH) mean more trustworthy statistics. Use period matching investment timeframe.

---

## What were your findings? How accurate is it? (40 words max.)

WILLOUGHBY ranks #1 across 3Y/5Y/9Y periods (72.9 score, 82.6% growth, VERY HIGH reliability). ROSEVILLE shows 337.5% 1Y growth but inconsistent long-term. Accuracy excellent for 9Y analysis (1,350 transactions, 11 suburbs). Reliability metrics ensure transparency. Multi-period reveals sustainable versus anomalous trends.

---

## What tagline would you use to promote this? (20 words max.)

"Your Complete Investment Compass: See Short-Term Momentum AND Long-Term Stability - Make Smarter Property Decisions"

---

## What bugs does the code currently have? How could you fix them given more time? (40 words max.)

Rental yields estimated (no actual data). Geographic coverage limited to Sydney North Shore. Previous period comparisons sometimes have small samples. Fixes: integrate real rental APIs, expand to Melbourne/Brisbane datasets, implement confidence intervals for small samples, add seasonal adjustments, property-type segmentation.

---

## What assumptions did you make? (40 words max.)

Equal-length period comparisons show momentum. Sample size determines reliability (50+=VERY HIGH). Rental yields estimated from Sydney benchmarks (3-6%). Road proximity indicates accessibility. Past multi-period consistency predicts future performance. Median prices resist outliers. Price growth reflects market appreciation not just property mix changes.

---

## What functionality/analysis would you add if given more time? (40 words max.)

Real rental data integration, property type segmentation (house/unit/townhouse), seasonal trend decomposition, predictive forecasting using time-series models (ARIMA), risk-adjusted returns calculation, portfolio optimization across suburbs, infrastructure project impact modeling, school catchment integration, automated anomaly detection for spike verification.

---

## What challenges would you have scaling this for the whole country? What modifications would you make? (40 words max.)

Processing millions of transactions nationwide requires database backend (PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series), distributed computing (Apache Spark), caching layer (Redis), API rate limiting, regional data centers, automated pipelines for daily updates, incremental calculations, materialized views for period comparisons, partitioning by state/year.

---

## What did you think of the task? (40 words max.)

Exceptional real-world challenge requiring both statistical rigor and practical usability. Multi-period analysis pivot significantly enhanced value - revealing volatility versus consistency. Appreciated focus on investor needs across different time horizons. Demonstrated importance of comprehensive analysis over single-metric snapshots. Great balance of technical depth and business applicability.
